Let's use `editorPrompt()` to implement a minimal search feature. When they
type a search query and press enter, we'll loop through all the rows of the
file, and if a row contains their query string, we'll move the cursor to the
substring that matched and that will be the end of the search.

`strstr()` comes from `<string.h>`.

After getting their query, we check if they pressed escape by seeing if
`editorPrompt()` returned `NULL`, and if so, we abort the search.

Otherwise, we loop through all the rows of the file. We use `strstr()` to check
if `query` is a substring of the
