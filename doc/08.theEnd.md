## Differences from antirez's code

He wrote it in "a few hours across two weekends with programmed family
activities and meat to prepare for friends in long barbecue sessions." He
reused a lot of code from his `linenoise` and `LOAD81` projects. So the code
was kind of messy, with bugs from lack of testing various edge cases and code
paths. It wasn't really suitable to use for a programming tutorial like this.
However, once I fixed many of the bugs (with the help of the issues and pull
requests submitted to [kilo on GitHub](https://github.com/antirez/kilo)) and
cleaned up the code a bit, it turned out to be a great program to use for this
kind of tutorial.

* scrolling
* `rx`
* nonprintables
* `die()`
* `editorPrompt()` with callback

## Ideas for features to add on your own

* Line numbers
* Automatic indentation
* "Hard" line wrapping (insert a new line when the user types past the end of
  the screen)
* "Soft" line wrapping (use multiple lines on the screen to display single
  lines that are too long)
