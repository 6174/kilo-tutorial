# Build Your Own Text Editor

Welcome. This is an instruction booklet that shows you how to build a text
editor in C.

The text editor is [antirez's kilo](http://antirez.com/news/108), with some
minor changes. It's about 1000 lines of C, and it implements all the basic
features you expect in a minimal editor, as well as syntax highlighting and a
a search feature.

This booklet walks you through building the editor in about **160 steps**. Each
step, you'll add, change, or remove a few lines of code. Most steps, you'll be
able to **observe the changes** you made by compiling and running the program
immediately afterwards.

Each step is preceded by a **short summary** of what the change does, and why
we are making it. And each step is followed by a **detailed explanation** of
the code that was added. I encourage you to always read the short summary
preceding each step, but only read the detailed explanation if you are
interested in those details.

Don't feel like you have to read everything, or even understand anything. The
main point of this is that **you're going to make a text editor**, and you'll
have written every line of code of it, and it will feel great no matter how
much of the code you understood.
