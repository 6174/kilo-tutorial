# Build Your Own Text Editor

Welcome! This is an instruction booklet that shows you how to build a text
editor in C.

The text editor is [antirez's kilo](http://antirez.com/news/108), with some
minor changes. It's about 1000 lines of C, and it implements all the basic
features you expect in a minimal editor, as well as syntax highlighting and a
search feature.

This booklet walks you through building the editor in about **180 steps**. Each
step, you'll add, change, or remove a few lines of code. Most steps, you'll be
able to **observe the changes** you made by compiling and running the program
immediately afterwards.

I explain each step along the way, sometimes in a lot of detail. Free free to
skim or skip the prose, as the main point of this is that **you are going to
build a text editor from scratch**. Anything you learn along the way is bonus,
and there's plenty to learn just from typing in the changes to the code and
observing the results.
