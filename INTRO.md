# Build Your Own Text Editor

Hello. This is a tutorial that walks
you through writing a text editor in C.

You will start with an empty `main()`
function. You will then make a series
of about 100 small changes to the code,
typing them exactly as you see them.
Each step will be explained in detail.
Each step will add a new feature or fix
a bug, and you'll be able to run the
program after each step to see the
result. About half way through the
tutorial, when you implement saving to
disk, you can start using the text
editor to edit its own source code for
the rest of the tutorial, if you want.

You'll end up with about 1000 lines of
code that implement a working text
editor complete with syntax
highlighting and a search feature.

(Spoiler: the text editor is antirez's
`kilo`.)
